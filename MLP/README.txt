This is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning model.
 
It has been tested and trained on the datasets present in 
"MLP1.csv" and "MLP2.csv" files.

The main python code is in "MLP.py" file.
Test-Train split is randomized (20:80).

The code is generalized for 'd' features, 'c' classes, 
and 'h' hidden layers.

Pandas, Mathplotlib, and Numpy libraries are essential 
for the code to run.

A screenshot of the output (test results) can be found in 
'MLP_Test_Data_Output.png' file.

There is another python file - 'MLP_Logic_Gates.py' that tests
the model on AND, OR, XOR logic gates.

A screenshot of the output of the above python code can be
found in 'Logic_Gates_Output_Screenshot.png' file.

As evident from the output: -
  -> MLP with a single hidden layer works perfectly on 
     ALL three gates (100% accuracy, each).
