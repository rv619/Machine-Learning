This is a 1-D linear regression machine learning model. It has been tested 
and trained on the dataset present in "Linear_Regression_Data_1D.csv" file.

The main python code is in "linear_reg_1D.py" file.
Test-Train split is randomized.
 
Pandas, Mathplotlib, and Numpy libraries are essential for the code to run.

The output is divided into two parts: -
  --> "output_plot.png" contains the 2-D plot.
  --> "output_test.png" contains a screenshot of the tested data along with the results.
