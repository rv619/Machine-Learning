This is a demonstration of the Perceptron Learning Alorithm. It has been 
tested and trained on the dataset present in "PLA DATA.csv" file.

The main python code is in "pla.py" file.

Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy libraries are essential for the code to run.

The output is divided into two parts: -
  --> "output_plot.png" contains the 2-D plot.
  --> "output_test_results.png" contains a screenshot of the results 
       after running the algorithm 5 times.

Note: The code may not give the same results everytime as test-train split is randomized.

PS: The 20:80 test-train split gives 100% accuracy 3 / 5 times. 
However, the accuracy quotient decreases on increasing the split ratio.
